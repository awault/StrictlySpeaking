Strictly Speaking is a blog that leverages technology to gain insights on the economy and financial markets.

This blog is constructed with [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/awault/StrictlySpeaking). The layout is developed from the [Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) theme and makes use of the [mkdocs-blogging-plugin](https://pypi.org/project/mkdocs-blogging-plugin/). 

To the community of developers at [GitHub](https://github.com/) and [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - Thank you for your support! 

I'm overwhelmed by the multitude of selfless developers sharing their wealth of knowledge.
